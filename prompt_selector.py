prompt_selector.py

This module determines what kind of query a user is 
asking and builds the right prompt accordingly.

Includes:
- QueryCategory Enum to categorize different types of queries.
- PromptSelector class which analyzes user input and generate 
                the best possible prompt, with built-in error handling.
